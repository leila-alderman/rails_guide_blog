# Rails Guides: Getting Started

This project follows the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html) tutorial from the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) article.

This app is a minimalist blog with the ability to create, edit, and delete articles; create and delete comments; show all articles; show individual articles with the associated comments; and require basic authentication for creating, editing, updating, and deleting articles and for deleting comments.

This blog app does not use scaffolding but instead creates each element from scratch. This project also uses partials to clean up the views.
